if you want to place two servos on top of eachother and control them at the same time with arduino, you can use this.
extremly simple but from what i gathered, unique.
i made this because i had once bought a bunch of weak servos and wanted combine their power.
i don't know how to explain but place the servo with the side on top without the "turning" part on the other one's same area,
check the file "example" in the main branch for a visual representation
