if you want to place two servos on top of eachother and control them at the same time with arduino, you can use this. extremly simple but from what i gathered, unique
sad thing is if you turn one the other way you dont need this
i don't know how to explain but place the servo with the side on top without the "turing" part on the other one's same area

like this:
