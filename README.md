if you want to place two servos on top of eachother and control them at the same time with arduino, you can use this. extremly simple but from what i gathered, unique. i made this because i had once bought a bunch of weak servos and wanted combine their power.
sad thing is if you turn one the other way you dont need this.
i don't know how to explain but place the servo with the side on top without the "turing" part on the other one's same area
